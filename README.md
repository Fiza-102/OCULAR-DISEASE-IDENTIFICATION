# OCULAR-DISEASE-IDENTIFICATION
Fundus problems are the most typical causes of
blindness in people globally. The ophthalmic disease is noteworthy since it has features that are irreversible and might result in
long-term blindness. The majority of the identification models in use exclusively
concentrate on one particular ocular disease. Therefore, My
goal was to create a model for automatically classifying many
ocular diseases using fundus photos as input and reporting the
diseaseâ€™s name if it is present.
